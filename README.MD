# Sample C# Docker program
This was just a test to see if I could figure out how to create a container for a simple C# program before I move on to trying it out with more complicated programs.
## Details
This is a simple program that uses methods to perform basic mathematics. The goal was to dockerize the program. In order for the program to run in docker, you must run dotnet build first. I haven't tried this on another OS yet so I do not know how it behaves.
